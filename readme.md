# K-Quiz

> A web application built using React Router, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Our Mission

> To help people find new Kpop groups to listen to and learn about the discography of more groups.

---

## What We Aim To Provide

> Users of K-Quiz will be able to find new Kpop artists using our Group Finder form. This form determines Kpop groups that a user might enjoy listening to based on:

1. A genre, theme, topic, or mood
2. Artists they already listen to
3. An Kpop artist chosen at random
4. Popular Kpop songs
5. A playlist they listen to

## Architecture

> Our frontend tech stack consists of React w/ React Router to create beautiful Reactive component based UIs and create a multi-page application. We'll be taking advantage of SSR, RSC, and server actions to improve SEO and reduce page load times by having our heavy computations and functions run on the server. This reduces the amount of client-side javascript and creates a smoother user experience.

> Our backend uses Express.js to create an server API where we process client requests, execute our application's business logic, and store/ fetch data from our Postgres database using Prisma's ORM features.
